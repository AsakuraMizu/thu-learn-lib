# thu-learn2018-lib

This is a JavaScript library aimed to provide a program-friendly interface of [learn 2018 of Tsinghua University](https://leran2018.tsinghua.edu.cn).

## Compatibility

Since the library itself does not handle cookies, it can only be used in browsers.

I don't like polyfill. Just upgrade your browser, then problems will go away.
